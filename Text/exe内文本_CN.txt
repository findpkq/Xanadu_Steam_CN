Not only can you #c4break#c1 wooden crates, but you can also #c4push#c1 them!
Be careful when carrying wooden crates!
Start by pushing from the left or right!
You can also stand on top of a crate.
When a crate is broken, you can push another crate on top of it.
It's a neat trick to get even higher.
Make use of these two on the left.
Start by putting the first crate in the center...
Keep pushing it until it hits an obstacle.
You can make use of unbreakable boxes.
You'll need three boxes of the same color to break them.
They'll remove obstacles whose color matches the boxes.
Now if we partially destroy the box in the back on the right...
There is a switch on the left side.
You'll need three boxes of the same color to break them.
To use the switch you'll need to place a box of the same color on it.
To clear the puzzle on the left, place a matching color box on it.
